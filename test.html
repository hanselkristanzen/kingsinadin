    <p><i>A long time ago, there was a married couple living in Sebedang Village, part of Sambas Kingdom. They had no children. One day, they looked for firewood in the forest. They heard a baby crying in the middle of the forest. They quickly found the baby and took care of him. They named the baby Zamil. During the year, their life had improved. They were blessed with health and happiness. The most exciting thing that happened in their life during the year was the wife finally conceived a baby. It was something they had been longing for. </i>

        <h2>------</h2>
        <p> Life in this world goes according to God’s plan. There is a beginning and an ending. There is life, and there is death. Likewise, Tohari and Sani had undergone moments of happiness raising their children. Days of happiness, however, had passed. Tohari passed away at the end of dawn. Tohari was usually up in a third of night, not that day. He slept for good.</p>
        <p> After the death of Tohari, Sani told a story. It started three days before he died. It began with a dream. That night, Tohari had a nightmare. “Tan Unggal, Tan Unggal, let the children go.” That was what he said when he was having the dream. </p>

        <h2>------</h2>
        <p> When Sani asked him in the afternoon, Tohari did not say a word. For three consecutive days, Tohari looked gloomy. The night before he died, he finally spoke to Sani in only a few sentences. Tohari said in his dream, Tan Unggal would achieve his aspiration. But he did not tell me what it was. </p>
        <p>After Tohari had passed away, Sani lived in sadness. After some time, she fell ill. One month later, she passed away and was buried next to her husband. After their parents passed away, Zamil and Tan Unggal lived a hard life as farmers. </p>

    <p><i>One day, Tan Unggal decided to merantau. Years passed and there was no news about Tan Unggal for years until one day. A messenger from the Kingdom of Sambas came to Sebedang Village. He was sent to declare the Sebedang Village was included in the territory of the Kingdom of Sambas. Far away in the Kingdom of Sambas, there had been a change of leadership. A new king had been crowned. The name of the king was Tan Unggal. Tan Unggal was a powerful king who was immune to weapon attacks. Having been aware of his power, Tan Unggal became arrogant and ignorant. There was an interesting story about King Tan Unggal. One day he ordered his royal chef to make miding soup. There was, however, an incident that made the clear soup turn to red. When the chef was preparing the miding leaves, he accidentally cut his finger. Blood was all over the miding leaves. The chef became frightened because the king had been waiting in the dining room. He knew the king did not like to wait longer. But Tan Unggal liked the soup. Since then whenever King Tan Unggal asked for miding soup, the chef must sacrifice blood. </i>

    <p><i>King Tan Unggal had 2 children. Bujang Nadi and Dara Nandung. As time went by, Bujang Nadi and Dara Nandung had grown up and they were good-looking. One day, while they were in the garden, Bujang Nadi spoke to his sister, praising her beauty. Likewise, Dara Nandung told him that she wanted her future husband to look as handsome as him. Each one of them wanted to marry someone who was as good looking as their sibling. But that conversation was misheard by a guard. Soon it became wildly spreading rumors that finally reached Tan Unggal’s ears. The rumor that came to King Tan Unggal was that Bujang Nadi and Dara Nandung wanted to marry each other. King Tan Unggal became furious. He immediately sentenced them to be buried alive in Sebedang Hill. Until now, Sebedang Hill still holds the memory of Bujang Nadi and Dara Nandung in the form of an exile room. As for King Tan Unggal, he died locked in an iron chest drowned in the middle of Sambas River. That was how the cruel king ended. </i>
